# techinical-challenge
Software developer Technical challenge

Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this challenge. I went into this with no prior experinece in web development,
but have come out of it having learned a ton about html, css and javascript. My project may be a bit rougher than others you
may receive, but I am still thankful for this chance to learn. If this opportunity to work for Shine Solar does not work out,
I will definitely apply to work at your company again once I've learned more.

Thank you again,
David Doria
